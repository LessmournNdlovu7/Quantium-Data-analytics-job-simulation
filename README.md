# Retail Analytics & Commercial Insights Job Simulation 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a chain store customer purchasing behavior on chips and evaluates the impact of a new store layout 
on total sales. Using R, I conducted data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to uncover
key insights and test a store layout change in a controlled trial.

## Key Insights
The top three customer segments contributing to total sales:
1. **Budget older families** 
2. **Mainstream young singles/couples**
3. **Mainstream retirees**

## Sales Drivers:
- Older families purchase the most packets per customer.
- Mainstream young singles/couples have the largest population and prefer Tyrells chips.

## Store Trial & Results:
- A trial of a new store layout was conducted in three stores, with a control store chosen for comparison.
- The trial stores saw a significant increase in total sales and customer count, confirming the success of the new layout.

## Approach & Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed outliers using summary statistics.
- Merged transactional data with customer purchase behavior.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Created visualizations to analyze customer segments and sales trends.
  
3. Trial & Control Store Selection
- Identified comparable control stores to assess the impact of the layout change.
  
4. Performance Evaluation
- Measured the difference in sales and customer count before and after the trial.

## Technologies Used
- R (Data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis)
- ggplot2 (Data visualization)
- dplyr (Data manipulation)
